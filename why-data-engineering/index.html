    <p>A few years ago a colleague of mine explained how, when asked about his
role, he would glibly respond, &quot;I do things with computers&quot;. At the time this
sounded fairly reasonable. I too have fun doing things with computers and will
always consider myself something of a generalist technologist.</p>
<p>However, having been involved in a variety of projects, I've begun to realise
it's the data-intensive ones which particularly hold my interest. So I'm now
embracing this and taking on data engineering as a full time role.</p>
<p>Whilst it's not the first time I have held this job title, working in
tech consulting has broadened my horizons on the various challenges folks have
getting value from their data and I find myself returning to the role with
newfound enthusiasm.</p>
<h3 id="distilling-data-enabling-decision-making">Distilling Data &amp; Enabling Decision Making</h3>
<p>The goal of this post was to share with you why I think data engineering is a
pretty exciting discipline. And that remains the case. But, truth be told, as I
started writing I had a minor identity crisis as to what exactly my role as a
data engineer should entail. So I had a go at exploring some definitions.</p>
<p>Data engineers are variously described as being responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building and maintaining data pipelines.</li>
<li>Ensuring data is clean, reliable and accessible.</li>
<li>Using distributed computing to solve data-intensive problems.</li>
<li>Working with data scientists to deploy machine learning solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this a fair characterisation? Well, sort of. The above responsibilities do
describe activities that both myself and colleagues have carried out while
working on data projects. But, this explanation doesn't really touch on
<em>why</em> we do this work. Why do we build pipelines, optimise queries and scale
out clusters? What end are we working towards? Here is my attempt at
defining data engineering in terms of what it enables.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The practice of building software that can reliably distill data into a
meaningful form, such that a human or machine can easily make a decision
and/or take an action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, it's a lot easier to demonstrate value when you empower people to
confidently make a decision, or at the very least, reduce uncertainty. I
wouldn't even suggest we necessarily need super sophisticated techniques to do
so. Never underestimate the power in having the right data in the right
place, with some basic analysis.</p>
<p>This definition could also perhaps apply to data science, but I think that's
OK given the highly complementary nature of these two roles. In fact, as a
colleague of mine helpfully pointed out, if the act of &quot;distilling data&quot; is
orthogonal (i.e not exclusive to engineers or scientists), then the role of the
data engineer is about doing so with a focus on reliability, data quality and
data availability. I agree with this and think a key enabler for doing so is to
bring all the principles we know and love about making high quality software to
the realm of data. This includes practices like test driven development, domain
modeling, observability, etc. I would also make the case that in certain
circumstances it also entails building platforms to enable economy of scale.
(The <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html">Data Mesh</a> architecture is a great example of how to do this
elegantly.)</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-like-data-engineering">Reasons to like Data Engineering</h3>
<p>So now we have a bit more of an understanding as to what data engineers are
responsible for, let's explore some of reasons you might consider pursuing it as
a skill. Here are some things that motivated me.</p>
<h4 id="close-to-the-domain">Close to the domain</h4>
<p>Unlike my previous role as an infrastructure developer*, data engineering
fully immerses you within a particular domain. Calculating sales forecast for a
supermarket? You are probably going to learn a fair bit about the economics of
avocados. Building a routing service to plan journeys? You run the risk of
eventually becoming something of a train geek.</p>
<p>Every dataset has its own quirks. For example, while working within automotive
retail I uncovered some quite interesting 'rare colours' of car (colours that
only appear once in a dataset of several million cars). I was amused to
discover that car manufacturers would do things like describe a completely
unremarkable SUV as being &quot;Mystic Beige&quot; - definitely an oxymoron.</p>
<p>I love finding a weird outlier in the dataset and trying to uncover the story
behind it. <em>&quot;What on earth happened here, did a single customer really order
187 mangos?&quot;</em> Working in data is rewarding for those who are fundamentally very
curious.</p>
<p>Also, it's gratifying to see users glean insights from data you have delivered.
This is great. It's a valuable form of feedback and it's easy to see the
impact of your work.</p>
<p>* <em>Big respect for infra-devs. This work is super valuable, sometimes under
appreciated and so so vital to get right.</em></p>
<h4 id="but-still-close-to-the-metal">But still close to the metal</h4>
<p>Ultimately, all data, whether the colour of a car, or a count of mangos sold,
is stored as a series of bits and bytes in one or more computers. Whilst I enjoy
indulging my data-curiosity, I also find a lot of satisfaction in learning
about the lower-level mechanics of how these values move about the computer.
Not always, but often enough, having some appreciation of this can also be
particularly important when designing and implementing data solutions.</p>
<p>This applies to all sorts of cases. Maybe the data is big, maybe the data is
small but computationally expensive. Perhaps the data needs to be fetched from
a distant machine running a strange and arcane legacy system. In these
situations, where performance starts to matter, we need to pay attention as to
how the shape of the problem intersects with the strengths and weaknesses of
the hardware we are building on top of.</p>
<p>This concept of designing software to take into account the design of the
underlying hardware is sometimes expressed as &quot;mechanical sympathy&quot;. This term
was popularised by <a href="https://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com">Martin Thompson</a> and attributed to the Formula 1
racing champion Jackie Stewart. He &quot;believed the best drivers had enough
understanding of how a machine worked so they could work in harmony with it&quot;.</p>
<p>We can use this principle to guide many of our design choices when coming up
with solutions. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data locality and <a href="https://gist.github.com/hellerbarde/2843375">latency</a>: Are we fetching data from the CPU cache,
memory, disk or network?</li>
<li>Memory vs compute trade-off: Is it more efficient to pre-calculate values at
the cost of using more memory?</li>
<li>Parallelism: Would this be faster if we took advantage of more CPU cores?</li>
<li>Data-oriented programming: Should my collection of data be represented as an
array of structs, or a struct of arrays? Would vectorisation be faster?</li>
<li>Database choice: Is this database technology designed for analytical
workloads? What indexes should we use?</li>
<li>Lazy evaluation: Can we process the data as a stream instead of loading the
entire data set at once?</li>
</ul>
<p>Even when performance isn't as much of a concern, there are still compelling
economical and ecological arguments to be made for being at least mindful of
this and writing software that uses less resources.</p>
<h4 id="room-for-innovation">Room for innovation</h4>
<p>The other main reason I want to invest in data engineering is because the
entire &quot;data&quot; field continues to have lots of interesting developments.</p>
<p>There are focused but useful tools such as <a href="https://www.getdbt.com">DBT</a> that help compose data
transformations. There are projects like <a href="https://arrow.apache.org">Apache Arrow</a> which aim to
establish solid foundations for the interplay of data between different
technologies in the open source ecosystem. We have programming languages such
as Rust that demonstrate a <a href="https://andygrove.io/2018/01/rust-is-for-big-data/">lot of potential for solving data intensive
problems</a>.</p>
<p>Exciting happenings in the ops space could be beneficial to experiment with.
For example, instrumenting data pipelines for <a href="https://docs.honeycomb.io/learning-about-observability/intro-to-observability/">observability</a>. We are also
starting to see examples of how to do <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html">continuous delivery for machine
learning</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond technology, the shape of collaboration is also evolving. Instead of a
central team managing pipelines, many are now embedding data engineers in
product teams.</p>
<h3 id="being-excited-about-data">Being excited about data</h3>
<p>If you've read this far, you can see I'm enthusiastic about diving into
all things data. My plan is to keep writing data-related articles on this
blog, and I will have some interesting topics to share in due course.</p>
<p>Let's see what the next decade brings for data engineering and software
development. Exciting times!</p>
