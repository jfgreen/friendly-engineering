# Why I like Data Engineering 

A few years ago a colleague of mine explained to me how, when asked about his
role, he would glibly respond with something along the lines of: "i do things
with computers". At the time this sounded fairly reasonable. I too have fun
doing things with computers and will always consider myself somewhat of a
generalist technologist.

However, out of all the projects I have worked on, I have begun to realise that
it's the ones that are in some way data intensive that particularly hold my
interest. After some thought I have decided to embrace this and take on data
engineering as a full time role.

While this is not the first time I have held the data engineering job title,
working in tech consulting has broadened my horizons on the various challenges
folks have getting value from there data and I find myself returning to the
role with newfound enthusiasm.

The goal of this post was to share with you why I think data engineering is a
pretty exciting discipline. But, truth be told, as I starting writing I had a
minor identity crisis around what exactly my role as a data engineer should
entail, so first, lets explore some definitions. 

Data engineers have been variously described as being responsible for:

- Building and maintaining data pipelines.
- Ensuring data is clean, reliable and accessible.
- Using distributed computing to solve data intensive problems.
- Working with data scientists to deploy machine learning solutions. 

Is this a fair characterisation? Well, sort of. The above responsibilities do
describe activities that both myself and colleagues of mine have carried out
while working under the umbrella of data engineering. However, this explanation
doesn't really touch on  _why_ we do this work. Why do we build pipelines,
optimise queries and scale out clusters? To what end are we working towards?
Here is my attempt as defining data engineering in terms what it enables.

Ultimately, it's a lot easier to demonstrate value when you make people feel
empowered to confidently make a decision, or at the very least, reduce
uncertainty. I wouldn't even suggest we necessarily need super sophisticated
techniques to do so either. Never underestimate the power in having the right
data in the right place, with even some super basic analysis.

The above definition is perhaps very similar mission statement to data science,
but I think that's OK given the highly complementary nature of these two roles.
In fact, as a colleague of mine helpfully pointed out, if the act of
"distilling data" is is orthogonal (i.e not exclusive to data engineers or
scientists), then the role of the data engineer is about doing so with a focus
on reliability, data quality and data availability. I agrees with this and
think a key enabler for doing so is to bring all the practices we know and love
about making high quality software to the realm of data. This includes things
like...

What I like about this definition is that is allows us to be quite imaginative
in how we achieve it. For example:

- Maybe data engineering is less about owning _all the pipelines_ and instead
  finding ways to empower developers to better shape the data flowing from
  their products.
- Perhaps instead of struggling to "clean" data, we focus on using domain
  driven design techniques to ensure data is coherently mapped from one domain
  to another.
- Could we solve the problem with a small python script instead of a
  distributed computing framework?

So, what makes this a compelling discipline to invest in?

*Close to the domain.*

*But still close to the metal.*

*Increasingly in demand.*

*Lots of room for innovation.*
